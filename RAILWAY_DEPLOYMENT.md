# Railway Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your STOMP Fixed Income Server to Railway.

## Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **GitHub Repository**: Your code should be in a GitHub repository
3. **MongoDB Atlas**: Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster is running

## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

‚úÖ **Already Done**: Your repository is now Railway-ready with:
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- Updated `package.json` with engines and health check
- Environment variable support
- Health check endpoint
- Production-ready server configuration

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### Option A: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Connect Railway to GitHub**:
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your `stomp-server` repository

2. **Railway will automatically**:
   - Detect it's a Node.js project
   - Install dependencies
   - Use the configuration from `railway.json`

### Option B: Deploy with Railway CLI

1. **Install Railway CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login and Deploy**:
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway link
   railway up
   ```

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In your Railway dashboard, add these environment variables:

### Required Variables:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://datatableuser:YOUR_PASSWORD@cluster0.yslqyef.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
DATABASE_NAME=stomp_server
POSITIONS_COLLECTION=positions
TRADES_COLLECTION=trades
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Optional Variables:
```
PORT=8080                    # Railway will set this automatically
HEALTH_PORT=3000            # For health checks
```

## Step 4: Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In Railway dashboard, go to your service
2. Click "Settings" > "Domains"
3. Click "Generate Domain" for a free Railway subdomain
4. Or add your custom domain

## Step 5: Monitor Your Deployment

### Health Check Endpoints:
- **Health Status**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- **Service Info**: `https://your-app.railway.app/`

### WebSocket Connection:
- **WebSocket URL**: `wss://your-app.railway.app`
- **Protocol**: WSS (secure WebSocket)

## Step 6: Initialize Database (One-time Setup)

After deployment, you need to migrate your data to MongoDB:

### Option A: Run Migration Locally
```bash
# Set your production MongoDB URI in config.env
npm run migrate-to-mongodb
```

### Option B: Use Railway Console
1. In Railway dashboard, go to your service
2. Click "Command" tab
3. Run: `npm run migrate-to-mongodb`

## Project Structure for Railway

```
stomp-server/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ railway.json              # Railway configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json              # Updated with engines & health check
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server2.js                # Main server (production-ready)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mongoDataAccess.js        # MongoDB data layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ migrateToMongoDB.js       # Data migration script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ healthCheck.js            # Health check server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.env                # Environment variables (not in Git)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore                # Excludes large files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md     # This guide
```

## Railway Features Used

### üöÄ **Auto-Deploy**
- Automatic deployments on Git push
- Zero-downtime deployments

### üìä **Monitoring**
- Built-in metrics and logs
- Health check monitoring
- CPU and memory usage

### üîß **Environment Variables**
- Secure environment variable management
- Easy configuration updates

### üåê **Networking**
- Automatic HTTPS/WSS
- Custom domains supported
- Global CDN

## Testing Your Deployment

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.456,
  "database": "connected",
  "memory": {...},
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### 2. WebSocket Connection
Use your existing client code but connect to:
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://your-app.railway.app');
```

### 3. STOMP Protocol Test
Your existing STOMP clients will work with the new WSS URL.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Check MongoDB URI in environment variables
   - Ensure MongoDB Atlas allows connections from 0.0.0.0/0
   - Verify database credentials

2. **Health Check Failing**
   - Check logs in Railway dashboard
   - Verify MongoDB connection
   - Check if health check port is correct

3. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - Ensure using WSS (not WS) for production
   - Check if Railway service is running
   - Verify firewall settings

### Logs and Debugging:
- View logs in Railway dashboard under "Deployments"
- Use Railway CLI: `railway logs`
- Health check endpoint provides diagnostic info
